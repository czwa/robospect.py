# robospect.py
Python port of robospect

The current working codebase is on the master branch.  Development work is still ongoing, so nothing is guaranteed to be in a final state yet.

The plan is to have an initial release (with limited functionality) created from master after the dev-201904 branch is merged.

Installation now is functional, so after unpacking/cloning:
      > python3 ./setup.py install [--user]
or
      > python3 ./setup.py develop [--user]
depending on if code development will be performed.
